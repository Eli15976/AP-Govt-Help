					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">Some dads refused to let their kids to continue to go to school for religious reasons. Their kids were aged 14 and 15. There is also a state law stating that children under the age of 16 are required to go to school. The dads believed it goes against their right to religion, because going to school at age 14 is against their religion.</p>

					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 1st amendment was involved in this case. Freedom of Religion is involved, where anyone is allowed to express and practice their own religion.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor of Yoder (7-2). Religious families are allowed to drop out of school for religious reasons. The state cannot prevent them from doing so since it violates the 1st amendment.</p>
