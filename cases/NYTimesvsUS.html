					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">The NY Times published private information about the government (more specifically, the president) to the public. They exposed the government's decision of the Vietnam War. The President thinks that the NY Times should not be able to publish private information about the government, but the NY Times believes they have the freedom of the press.</p>

					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 1st amendment was involved in this case. It states that the people should have the freedom of the press, and that they can express themselves with anything they print on paper.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor of the NY Times (6-3). There should be no restriction on what people can publish. The president was just trying to hide his face from the public because when the NY Times published the paper, it made the president look bad. Since publishing the article does not present a Clear and Present Danger, the NY Times were allowed to publish it.</p>
