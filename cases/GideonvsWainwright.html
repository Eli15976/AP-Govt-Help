					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">Gideon broke into a pool hall and stole money. That was indeed a crime that he did. However, during his trial in, he requested for a lawyer and did not get one. The state government said that lawyers were reserved for the poor and major crimes that would deserve a death punishment if the defender loses. Gideon sued because he thought is was unfair for him since he doesn't have someone as knowledgable to help defend him.</p>

					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 6th and 14th amendment were involved in this case. 6th amendment, to have a right to a lawyer when requested. 14th amendment, states cannot take away the rights to provide a lawyer.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor of Gideon (9-0). Courts should provide a lawyer when the defendant asks for one. Without a lawyer, the defendant cannot properly defend itself from the accuser.</p>
