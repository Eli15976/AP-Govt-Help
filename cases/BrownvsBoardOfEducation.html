					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">A colored individual wanted to enroll their daughter to a white's school. However, the school denied their entrance just because of their color. This denial is forcing Brown's daughter to walk a further distance in order to even get an education. Brown thinks this is violating thier equal protection, since a further travel meant higher chance of being abused or harassed.</p>

					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 14th amendment was involved, The 14th amendment talks about how everyone in the country should have equal protection. Everyone should have the same protection under the law, no one should be left behind.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor Brown (9-0). It is more hazardous to travel a longer distance to get to school, than going to a school nearby your own neighborhood. This has also ended the Separate but Equal Doctrine.</p>
