					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">Police searched Mapp's house without a warrent because the police believed that she was protecting a suspected bomber. Though they did not find any evidence, Mapp was arrested for possessing obscene pictures. Mapp sued because the Police did <span style="font-weight:800;">NOT</span> have a warrent to search her house.</p>

					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 4th amendment was involved in this case. People are allowed to be secure in their own homes, and not unlawful or unreasonable seizures should or will be allowed.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor of Mapp (5-4). Evidence without a warrent would be nullified or void. You cannot use evidence that has been obtained illegally.</p>
