					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">Mcdonald owned guns to protect himself from thieves or burglars. However the state of Chicago wanted to ban guns. Mcdonald thinks this is unfair. He believes he has the right to bear arms and to own a gun.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 2nd amendment was involved in this case, stating that people should have the rights to bear arms, without the government taking away that right. The 14th amendment was also involved, saying that no state should deprive a person from their life, liberty, or property.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor of Mcdonald (5-4), the Bill of Rights also applied to the state government because the 14th amendment shows that no state can take away a person's natural rights, including ones stated in the Bill of Rights.</p>
