					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">Louisiana had a separation between colored and whites while riding a car. However, plessy, who is 1/8 colored, sat in a white's car and refused to move when he was asked to. He believes this is violating his equal protection, so he sued.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 14th amendment was involved in this case, because Plessy thinks that he wasn't equally protected.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor of Ferguson (7-2). According to them, the 14th amendment wasn't violated because even thought it is separate, it is still equal. They see no change in treatment of the 2 cars.</p>
