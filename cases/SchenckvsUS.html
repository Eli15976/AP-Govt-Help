					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">Schenck burns draft papers in order to protest against the Espionage act. He burns it because he believes that the government cannot limit people's speech no matter what the reason is. However, the US wants to limit negative speech about the government.</p>

				<div>
					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 1st amendment and 13th amendment were involved in this case. The Espionage act was also involved, since it's the act talking about the 1st and 13th amendment. 1st amendment because people are limited to speech, and 13th amendment because forcing people to go to war seems like putting people into labor.</p>

					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor of the US (9-0). Though people should have the right to speech freely, the government should also limit some freedom since it's necessary and proper to keep away "clear and present danger." <i style="font-weight:100;color:gray;">(For example, you cannot shout "Fire!" at a movie theater, since it causes panic and people getting hurt.)</i> It is also necessary and proper for people to serve in the US military and go to war. If no one is willing to go and no one shows up, the US has no way to protect itself, and the country would fall quickly.</p>
