					<h3>Issue</h3>
					<p class="description">The NY Stateboard of Regents authorized a short, voluntary prayer at the start of every school day. However, some parents challenged the prayer saying that it violates their rights of free religion. They believed that this violates their right to have their own religion.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Parts of the Constitution Involved</h3>
					<p class="description">The 1st amendment were involved in this case. The Establishment Clause is also involved in this case. The 1st amendment gives people freedom of expression, to show what they believe in freely. The Establishment Clause says that the government cannot promote nor create any religion.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Decision</h3>
					<p class="description">The court was in favor of the parent, Engle (6-1). It is unconstitutional to have prayers in schools. Religion and states should be kept seperate, and the Stateboard was violating that rule.</p>
