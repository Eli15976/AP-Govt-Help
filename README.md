## Helps AP Government Students with their studies

**Link to Website:** https://eli15976.github.io/AP-Govt-Help/

This website was created for the purpose of helping future AP Government students. I personally have suffered through AP Government, and it sucked. So I'm making this user friendly website for people to use as research.

Subjects listed are:
```
Bill Of Rights
Constitution
```
