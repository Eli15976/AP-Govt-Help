				<h3>Freedom Own Guns</h3>
				<p class="description">People are allowed to own guns. Their rights of owning a gun should not be taken away. They are allowed to have a gun and use it for self defense, like when a burglar enters your house, and you don't want to die, you can take out your gun and threaten him away, or even shoot him if he doesn't comply.</p>
				<i>Important Notice: You are still needed to have a license before getting a long gun. Short guns like pistols are fine without license.</i>
