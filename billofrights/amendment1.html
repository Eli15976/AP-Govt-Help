				<h3>Freedom of Expression</h3>
				<p class="description">People are allowed to express anything they want. They can express it in speech, religion, petitions, gatherings, and much more. The government cannot make any laws or regulations against the people's freedom of expression. People are allowed to assemble, and speak about what they want changed. Nothing will be stopping them from doing so.</p>
				<i>Important Notice: Amendment 1 does not protect you from intentionally creating chaos. You are not allowed to scream "fire!" in a plane, when there isn't any fire (See <a href="">Espionage act</a>)</i>
